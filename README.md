## Datasets
The other preprocessed datasets are too large to be posted on GitHub. They can be downloaded from Baidu cloud drive: [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_EemCZ4XOiIX07JemSTpaA?pwd=shgp](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_EemCZ4XOiIX07JemSTpaA?pwd=shgp).



## Base Encoder
For the Att-HGNN module of SHGP, we adopt our previously proposed ie-HGCN as its base encoder. Please refer to our ie-HGCN repository: [https://github.com/kepsail/ie-HGCN](https://github.com/kepsail/ie-HGCN).
